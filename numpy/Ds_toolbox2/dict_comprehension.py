# Recall that the main difference between a list comprehension and a dict comprehension is the use of curly braces {} instead of []. Additionally, members of the dictionary are created using a colon :, as in <key> : <value>.


# Create a dict comprehension where the key is a string in fellowship and the value is the length of the string. Remember to use the syntax <key> : <value> in the output expression part of the comprehension to create the members of the dictionary. Use member as the iterator variable.
